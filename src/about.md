Hello, I'm Andy Peters.  I live in Omaha, NE with the love of my life [Amanda Rucker](https://amandarucker.com/), our doggo [Chewie](/chewie) and cat [Rey](/rey/).  You can usually find me with them or [riding bikes](/bikes/) or with them while riding bikes; you know ... depends on the day.

Recently I went out [on my own to build a new web SaaS product](/whats-next) that is focused on solving a problem I believe in for those who manage rental properties.  I have been trying to write more about the journey of creating and a new SaaS product.  It will all be right [here](/blog).

Before that, [I was at Flywheel](/i-joined-flywheel) for about five years.  At [Flywheel](https://getflywheel.com) I was an early employee at a fast growing startup and I got to get reacquainted with Ruby on Rails and the Javascript ecosystem.  It was awesome being part of such a fast growing team, getting a chance to deliver so many products to happy customers, and being part of their acquisition.  A great opportunity.

Way before joining Flywheel, I spent more than 5 years running a [freelance agency under the name Ninth Division](i-was-not-an-entreprenuer-i-was-a-freelancer/).  We found our niche building iOS and Android applications during a time when that was new.  In between Ninth Division and Flywheel, I spent time with the [1Password](https://1password.com) team on the iOS and Mac app development team.  I loved seeing how they built a remote team and it was a great experience working on such an iconic product in the Apple ecosystem.  In what seems like ancient history to me now, before all of that:  I was an early employee at Sojern and before that I was at Intuit for about five years.  These are times I really found technology and entrepreneurship.  This i why I left to start Ninth Division and the rest is history and summarized in the two paragraphs you just read.

Anyway, that's 3 paragraphs to summarize my 15+ years career.  I've been posting monthly to [my photos page](/photos) if you want to get to know a little more whats going on personally.  Hopefully I'll get back to writing [blog posts](/posts).  Reach out anytime, email is best:  **andypeters@hey.com**
