title: Chewie
subtitle: Chewie. I heard the internet likes dog photos too.  Oh good, then here's my co-pilot of 13+ years.  He prefers napping about 20 hours ahead, long two poop walks and occasionally telling bigger dogs he could take them.  He truly does roll his tongue out like a fruit-by-the-foot rollup.  How does one pick only four photos when I have a zillion?  Its tough, but I do the tough stuff so you don't have to.
