While in Idaho, I had ample time to explore the local singletrack trails.  I spent two whole days riding the cross country trails a few downhill lines at [Grand Targhee National Park](https://www.trailforks.com/region/grand-targhee-resort/).  These trails and this park will forever be considered the benchmark in cross country singletrack riding.  Perfect blend of beauty, flow and the best groomed trails I've ever been on.  I road my Kona Hei Hei which is a carbon cross country / trail frame geometry with 120mm travel up front and 100mm for the rear.  It was perfect for these trails.  I took this photo on the way up a downhill line; riding through the aspens up and then back down was a treat for this Nebraska trail rider.
