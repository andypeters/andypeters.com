At the end of September, we slipped away to Idaho, Wyoming and Montana.  For the first leg of the trip, we had this beautiful view of the Grand Tetons from our cabin. We stayed far away from mouth breathers and took in this view every morning and evening.  It was something else living each day inside a postcard.
