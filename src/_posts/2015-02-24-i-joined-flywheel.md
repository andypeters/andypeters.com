excerpt: I joined the great team at Flywheel.
---

I’m excited to announce that I joined the great <a href="http://getflywheel.com">Flywheel</a> team in Omaha as a senior software engineer. Flywheel is making a great impact on the Wordpress community by making hosting Wordpress sites dead simple. I haven’t been more excited about new work since the beginning days of Ninth Division.

So why Flywheel you might ask? I have a great deal of respect for Dusty, Tony and Rick; the founders of Flywheel. They are solving a great problem and have a big product roadmap that I want to be a part of. I’ve been looking to freshen my web development skills and creating some new ones. Everyone at this company is creative, the office is a refreshing place to be and I love perks - lunch! I’m looking forward to working with them all.

With the new walks in my life, that means less time available for extracurricular activities - such as blog posts, community engages and side projects. I’ll be taking a break to find a new sense of passion and creativity. We’ll see you soon.
