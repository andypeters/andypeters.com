Fall 2020.  Amanda snapped this photo and it accurately depicts a typical afternoon in the office.  Everyday we are in the office and around 2pm or 4pm, Rey kitty comes wondering in looking for some shoulders to lay on.  Also included in this photo is my fall time flannel, stocking cap because I'm always cold and tiny can of coke.
