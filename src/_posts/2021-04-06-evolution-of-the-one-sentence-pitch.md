Pitch sentence. The tag line. One liner.  Product description.  Call it what you will, but creating a single sentence that describes a business/product is just as hard as giving it a name.  It took a lot of time to come up with a name, but even more time to get create a pitch that can tell someone what [Doorkeep](https://doorkeep.co) is and who its for.

Here are some product descriptions I used in the past:

* The inbox for real estate.
* The property manager's inbox.
* The messaging app for rental managers and hosts.
* Text messaging for property managers.
* Cloud phone system for rentals.
* Rental management‚Äôs Message Center
* Organized communications for property managers.
* Help desk software for real estate management.

... and here is [Doorkeep's](https://doorkeep.co) product description / pitch as of today:  Customer service platform for your rental properties.

What will it evolve into in one year?
