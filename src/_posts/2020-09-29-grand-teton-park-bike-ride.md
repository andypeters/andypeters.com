Grand Teton National Park has an incredible paved bike path which goes from [Moose, WY](https://goo.gl/maps/6JszVp9h7aTrTvqM6) (the southern entrance town for the park) into the park.  The path
is roughly 20 miles round trip, flat (except one hill) and takes you to [Jenny Lake](https://goo.gl/maps/ejFgiKjxD9N98ceN8).  It was like riding a bike through a postcard.
