excerpt: Hello from Flywheel.
---

Here I am.. its November,&nbsp;I've been with <a href="http://andypeters.com/2015/02/flywheel/">Flywheel since February</a> of this year and&nbsp;I still love&nbsp;this team. &nbsp;When I started the company headed to Las Vegas for&nbsp;a remote work retreat. After that,&nbsp;I got started right away on a&nbsp;huge update to the app: Flywheel Organizations, and I've found I work with people that I'd hang out with normally. &nbsp;Good vibes&nbsp;here.

Want to learn more about me? &nbsp;Earlier this year, I&nbsp;conducted my&nbsp;<a href="https://getflywheel.com/layout/faces-of-flywheel-meet-andy-p/">'Faces of Flywheel' interview</a>. &nbsp;Everyone at the company does a <em>Faces of Flywheel interview. &nbsp;</em>Its a fun video interview with a followed up blog post. &nbsp;I learned I often forget what I am about to say when I see a camera, complete blank. &nbsp;There were at least 20 re-takes.

Getting&nbsp;back in Ruby programming has&nbsp;been&nbsp;a great change. &nbsp;Its been a good mix of remembering Ruby and re-learning it. &nbsp;I&nbsp;spent&nbsp;6+ years with Objective-C (recently Swift) and the&nbsp;iOS/Mac platform overall; all different from Ruby on Rails in the web. &nbsp;Early on I spent time writing spec tests to&nbsp;learn about the&nbsp;Flywheel environment more, but also stretch what I knew about Ruby and Rails quickly. &nbsp;As I moved on, I continue to stretch what I know&nbsp;about Ruby.

A month ago,&nbsp;I was featured in <a href="http://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/news/2015/10/flywheelalumni.php">UNO's IS&amp;T Alumni Highlight</a>; along with Rick and Kat. &nbsp;All three of us&nbsp;are (or will be) UNO alumni. &nbsp;It was fun to be part of that interview. &nbsp;We talked about what college meant and where we are now. &nbsp;While it took me a while to answer the questions, I realized that is much I have forgotten about college. &nbsp;It was nice to dig up old memories; like what my degree was even in. &nbsp;That's me on the right.

Flywheel is dog friendly, which means Chewie is there everyday. He's my Lhaso Alpso companion that I've had for 8 years now. &nbsp;He's an ex-therapy dog, so being at work and helping people relax is his what he does best (but mostly its simply him relaxing). &nbsp;When you stop by the offices, you'll likely be greeted by Chewie; if not you'll find him asleep on the couch or in his bed by me. &nbsp;<a href="http://omaha.dog">Omaha.dog</a>&nbsp;dropped a post on Facebook&nbsp;about hanging out with Johnny and the support team...
