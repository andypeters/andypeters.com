excerpt: The nighttime skyline of Omaha, NE from Lewis and Clark Park over in Council Bluffs.  We were over here hoping to catch a glimpse of the comet.  It became obvious that to see the comet, we'd need to go much further north.  So we drove an hour north and caught a glimpse.  We did not have the patience for photographing it.
